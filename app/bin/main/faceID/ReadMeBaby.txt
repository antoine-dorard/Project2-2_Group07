Face Detection and Recognition: OpenCV, Python, and Deep Learning

To run:
    Step 1: install all the dependencies by running (in the faceID folder): pip install -r requirements.txt
    Step 2: run the program (right click on the file and select "Run" or "Debug" or manually run it in the terminal)
        - DNN.py and HaasClassifier.py can be run independently
        - DNN-Socket.py and FaceDetection.java are run together and act as a socket in localhost.
            You need to first run the FaceDetection.java to initialize the socket and then run the DNN-Socket.py

Dependencies used:
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Install these dependencies using pip by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
If you do not have pip, just surf the web and find a tutorial on how to install it.
