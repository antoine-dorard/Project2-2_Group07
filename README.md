Our chatbot is designed to be user-friendly and accurate in its responses.
To ensure that our chatbot is delivering accurate responses, we have implemented a spelling checker using Levenshtein distance algorithm.
Additionally, we have added a method that allows users to add their own questions, giving our chatbot the ability to learn and expand its knowledge base.
We have also included a sleek and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to make interacting with our chatbot as smooth and enjoyable as possible.
